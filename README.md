# vanilla-modal
Write a script that would overwrite window.alert method as follows:
1. A modal slides onto the screen from the top of the window (0.5 second animation).
2. Modal displays site/app name (ex: “MyApp says:”), alert message, and ‘OK’ button (name and message are passed as method parameters).
3. Modal is centered (vertically and horizontally) on the screen if viewed on desktop/tablet, occupies full screen on mobile devices.
4. Modal fades out on button click (0.5 second animation).
5. Cross-browser compatible (must work in in IE11, Safari, Firefox, Chrome).
6. Styling of your choice with plain CSS (no libraries like Bootstrap).
7. Use vanilla JavaScript (no modal-generating libraries or jQuery).
